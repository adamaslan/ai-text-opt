      "To analyze \"inner beauty\", one must consider the depth and richness of qualities that lie within an individual, beyond mere physical appearance. Inner beauty encompasses a person's true essence, character, values, beliefs, hopes, and dreams. It is often reflected in their actions, interactions with others, and the way they carry themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some key aspects of inner beauty include:\n",
      "- Kindness and empathy - Demonstrating compassion towards others through words and deeds \n",
      "- Intelligence and curiosity - A thirst for knowledge and understanding that drives growth and learning\n",
      "- Creativity and innovation - The ability to think outside the box and find novel solutions/ideas\n",
      "- Integrity - Holding oneself accountable, doing what one says they will do, and being honest at all times  \n",
      "- Humor and wit - A light touch of irony, wordplay or playful banter \n",
      "- Selflessness - Putting others' needs before their own in a genuine way\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, inner beauty is not set in stone. It can shift based on circumstances and experiences over time. A person may develop new interests, opinions and ways of thinking that shape their identity from within. However, the core qualities tend to remain constant.\n",
      "\n",
      "At its core, inner beauty comes from living a life with purpose, authenticity and an open heart. As Socrates said, \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\" The most beautiful people are those who have spent time examining themselves in a mirror - both physically and psychologically speaking. \n",
      "\n",
      "So while outer beauty may fade over time, inner beauty endures as the truest measure of a person's value and character. It manifests through actions and words on display each day, revealing what lies within someone's heart. Inner beauty has enduring power and significance.\n",

      "I would analyze the query by focusing on key concepts from Gilles Deleuze's work on cinema and image philosophy. Some key terms to consider are \"cin√©matisme\" - the idea that cinema is a specific mode of perception, akin to the sensations produced by looking at images; \"actuality\" - the reality presented as real in cinematic perception; and \"becoming\" - how an image becomes visible through this process of actualization.\n",
      "\n",
      "To analyze inner beauty based on Deleuze's ideas: One could start by noting how cinema is not merely a passive reflection of external reality, but actively produces its own realities through this mode of perception. The act of looking at images and recognizing them as such involves an \"enfoldment\" or becoming-image that transforms the subject into an object of vision. \n",
      "\n",
      "Deleuze argues this envelopment occurs in three stages - \"the fold\" which is the first unfolding, \"the image\" where form takes shape, and finally \"the body.\" The first two are related to how images penetrate us as subjects and objects of perception while also revealing their underlying structure or depth. Only at the third stage do we reach a state of \"becoming-image,\" an actualization in which the subject merges with the object of vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if one wants to evaluate inner beauty based on Deleuze's concepts, they could consider how certain images are more apt at triggering this process of becoming than others. Certain shots or sequences may best penetrate and transform through their \"becoming.\" One might then analyze a particular image for its ability to convey depth, structure and subjectivity while also showing the full extent of each phase - fold, image and body. \n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Deleuze's philosophy provides an insightful framework for analyzing how images come into being as inner experiences that have aesthetic qualities associated with beauty or power. By focusing on concepts like cinema as a specific mode of perception, actualization through becoming, the role of subjective experience in forming impressions, and other key ideas from his work on image philosophy - one can develop a sophisticated approach to interpreting what makes some images more beautiful than others.\n",
